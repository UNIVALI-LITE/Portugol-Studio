* About AutoComplete

  AutoComplete is a Swing library that facilitates adding auto-completion
  (aka "code completion, "Intellisense") to any JTextComponent.  Special
  integration is added for RSyntaxTextArea (a programmer's text editor, see
  http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/ for more information), since this feature
  is commonly needed when editing source code.

* Example Usage

  See the AutoComplete example(s) on the RSyntaxTextArea examples page here:
  
     http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/examples/index.php
  
  They provide a good example of basic usage of the library, showing how to
  auto-complete a simple, fixed set of words (function names).
  
  Also see the AutoCompleteDemo project, which lives here in SVN:
  
     http://svn.fifesoft.com/svn/RSyntaxTextArea/

  It provides an example of loading completions from an XML file.  It
  demonstrates a code editor with completion support for the C Standard library,
  and demos the parameter assistance feature.
